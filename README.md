# *Sakura Ikebana Delivery* Game
## Intro
This was my final project for the subject "Programming I". The objective was to make a game based in the Naruto universe, using the programming language Java.
The project was very useful for me to apply the introductory concepts of POO, such as Classes, Objects, Instances, Methods and Atributtes.

The game can be played whether single player or multiplayer. The goal is to deliver the flowers to each house, avoiding (or eliminating) the evil ninjas and their dangerous shurikens ðŸ’¢
## Project status
I consider this project finished, but i don't discard doing future updates. There may be some bugs going arround!
For more info about the game, you can check the report (*informe*) uploaded to the repo. It's written in Spanish
